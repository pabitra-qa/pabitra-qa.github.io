                    beneficial to the group. Pabitra went above and beyond creating test cases and executing them.
                    Pabitra did the analysis to determine where the issues were and how to solution them. In addition,
                    he not only tested the Cognos reports, but worked to offer solutions within the BI tool to make the
                    report more robust for the business organization. The dedication, work effort, and knowledge he
